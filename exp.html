        <p>I worked for more than a year working for the University of Utah repiring different problems that would arise on the hundreds of Mac machines across campus. I also wrote some scripts to streamline many annoying processes.</p>
        <p>I gained a lot of experience working with back-end sort of things. I really came to understand the importance of good web design through the problems tha would be created because someone had misunderstood something.</p>

        <img id="expimg" src="images/fhl.jpg" alt="The Family History Library">
        <p>At the Family History Library in downtown Salt Lake City, I was working as an memeber of the QRC Team. Our main duties were to make sure everything in the library ran smoothly including all the different machines that were setup to help patrons.</p>
        <p>From my time at the FHL I learned many things about computers and other devices that I haddnt learned before. I also learned the importance of making things easy to understand because most patrons at the library are of an older generation that need things to be explained as simply as possible.</p>
